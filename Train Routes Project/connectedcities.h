    * Part A
    *
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ----
    * For each city in a city list, find the list of reachable cities starting from
  the city
    * following the train routes, and sort the cities in the descending order based
  on the
    * number of their reachable cities.
    *
    * Required specifications -
    *
    * Given a list of cities, and a list of one-way train routes from one city to
  another:
    *
    * 1) Create a graph with each node in the graph as an instance of the CityNode
  class,
    *    the graph can use any STL collection by your choice.
    *
    * 2) Populate the direct routes information to each CityNode's directRoutedCities
  collection.
    *
    * 3) For each city node in the graph, use Depth First Search algorithm to find
  all reachable
    *    cities starting from the city following the train routes and store those
  reachable cities to
    *    the CityNode's reachableCities collection.
    *
    *    IMPORTANT: The reachable cities must include the starting city itself.
    *
    *    Note: The train route can go from the starting city and stop at several
  cities
    *          before reaching the destination city, all cities including the
  starting city and
    *          the destination city along the path would be counted as reachable
  cities from
    *          the city where the train starts.
    *
    * 4) Sort the cities in the descending order based on the number of their
  reachable cities,
    *    so that after sorting, starting from the first city in the sorted order, the
  train can
    *    reach the greatest number of destination cities following the given one-way
  routes.
    *
    * 5) You must use a RECURSIVE algorithm to implement the Depth First Search part
  to find
    *    all reachable cities from a starting city given the train routes, using an
  iterative
    *    approach would result in a 30% penalty to your assignment 4 grade.
    *
    * 6) You may add necessary helper functions as needed. Follow the comments for
  hints.
    *
    * Assumptions -
    * 1) Each city is represented by a unique two-letter code like "SD", "LA",
    *    "SF", "SJ", "NY", etc.
    * 2) Each one-way train route is represented by a pair of city codes; for
  example,
    *    route {"SD", "LA"} means train can drive one-way from San Diego (SD) to
    *    Los Angeles (LA).
    *
    * <p>
    * Part B
    *
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ----
    * Show the upper bound of the time complexity of this function would be O(c^2 + c
  * r)
    * where:
    * c is the number of cities
    * r is the number of direct routes between cities
    *
    *
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ----
    * @param  cities  a list of cities with each city identified by a unique two
  letter code
    * @param  routes  pairs of one-way train routes with each one-way train route
  represented
    *                 by a pair of city codes; for example, route {"SD", "LA"} means
  train
    *                 can go one-way from San Diego (SD) to Los Angeles (LA).
    *
    *                 NOTE: examples of routes are { {"SD", "LA"},
    *                                                {"LA", "SJ"},
    *                                                {"SJ", "SF"}
    *                                              }
    *                       refer to driver.cpp for more examples.
    *
    * @return       A list of CityNodes in descending order of number of reachable
  cities and
    *               using ascending alphabetical order of the city code as the
  tiebreaker.
